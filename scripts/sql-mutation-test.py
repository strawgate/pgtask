"""Mutation-test the PL/pgSQL kernel.

`cargo-mutants` reaches the Rust crates, but pgtask's state machine lives in
`0001_initial.sql`, so nothing was measuring how much of it the test suite
actually pins down.

Every rule in the kernel is a predicate inside a `SECURITY DEFINER` function.
That makes mutation cheap: migrate a fresh database normally, then
`CREATE OR REPLACE` one function with a single predicate changed. No Rust
recompilation is involved, and `sqlx` migrations are idempotent so the suite's
own `migrate()` call leaves the mutant in place.

A mutant that the suite still passes is a rule nobody is testing.

    ./scripts/sql-mutation-test.py                 # run every mutant
    ./scripts/sql-mutation-test.py --list          # show them
    ./scripts/sql-mutation-test.py -k fencing      # run a subset
