// CapacityState is how many tasks a queue currently counts as outstanding.

// buildCapacityModel checks the admission control on a capacity-limited queue.
//
// From the docs: "When a queue sets max_outstanding_tasks, admission above the
// limit fails with SQLSTATE PT001", and "Queue capacity is backpressure, not
// task loss."
//
// The implementation does not count rows at admission time. It keeps a running
// `capacity_outstanding_tasks` on the queue row, incremented by a trigger on
// insert and decremented when a task reaches a terminal state. That is
// denormalised state, and denormalised state can drift: a counter that drifts
// low admits more than the limit allows, and one that drifts high starts
// rejecting work while the queue has room. Neither shows up in a snapshot of
// the tasks table, because the tasks table is not what admission consults.
//
// Modelling it as a bounded counter makes both directions detectable, since an
// admission decision that disagrees with the true outstanding count has no
// ordering that explains it.
//
//	enqueue()  -> {ok}   ok=false means PT001
//	complete() -> {ok}   frees a slot
