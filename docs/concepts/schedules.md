# Scheduling without a leader

Scheduling runs inside every worker you enable it on. There is no leader, no lock service, and no election.

That sounds like it should produce duplicate work. It does not, and the reason is worth understanding, because it is the
same trick used for every other piece of background maintenance in the system.

## How a schedule becomes tasks

1. A worker claims due schedule definitions with `SKIP LOCKED`. Two workers claiming at the same moment take different
   rows rather than blocking on each other.
2. Rust computes the occurrences for the interval or cron expression.
3. PostgreSQL advances `next_run_at` and inserts the tasks **in one transaction**.

If a worker dies in the middle, the transaction rolls back. The schedule keeps its old `next_run_at` and the next worker
picks it up. There is no partially advanced schedule.

## A schedule that cannot be materialized

Each claimed schedule is materialized inside its own savepoint, so one bad row does not roll back the rest of the batch.

A schedule fails the same way every time when its cron expression has no next occurrence (`0 0 0 30 2 *` asks for
February 30), when the worker cannot read the row (one written by a newer release during a rolling deploy, for
example), or when PostgreSQL rejects the tasks it would create. The worker logs a warning and moves that schedule's
`next_run_at` one minute forward without creating tasks, then tries it again. Occurrences that fall inside that minute
are not created. Other errors roll back the sweep, and the worker retries it with exponential backoff, up to
`schedule_reconciliation_interval`.

`Store::put_schedule` rejects a definition with no occurrence after its start. The SQL function `pgtask.put_schedule`
does not evaluate cron expressions, so a client that writes schedules over SQL must check that itself.

## The guarantee that makes it safe

A unique index on `(schedule_id, scheduled_for)` is what actually prevents duplicates:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tasks_schedule_occurrence_idx
    ON pgtask.tasks (schedule_id, scheduled_for)
    WHERE schedule_id IS NOT NULL;
```

Two workers may both decide that the 09:00 occurrence is due. Only one insert survives. The other conflicts and does
nothing.

This is the difference between *coordinating* and *making duplicates impossible*. A leader election is an attempt to
ensure only one worker tries. A unique key means it does not matter how many try.

!!! note "Every worker also does maintenance"

    The same `SKIP LOCKED` pattern divides expired-lease recovery, wait-timeout recovery, and retention deletion across
    whatever replicas happen to be running. Losing a worker does not stop maintenance; it just leaves fewer hands.

## Misfire policies

A schedule that was due while nothing was running has to decide what "catching up" means. That is a business question,
so you choose:

| Policy | Behaviour | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `skip` | Ignore everything missed; run at the next due time | The work is only useful now - a health probe, a cache refresh |
| `latest` | Run once for the most recent missed occurrence | You want current state, not a backlog - a nightly report |
| `catch_up` | Run every missed occurrence, bounded by `catch_up_limit` | Each occurrence is a distinct unit of work - per-hour billing rollups |

Whichever you choose, a discarded occurrence is counted. `pgtask.schedule.skipped_occurrences` records
the due occurrences a policy threw away, with the same queue, task, and kind attributes as
`pgtask.schedule.occurrences`.

Without it, `skip` and `latest` recover silently: the schedule looks healthy again and nothing says
that three hours of runs never happened. Alert on this counter being non-zero if the work matters.

`catch_up` is bounded on purpose. An unbounded catch-up after a long outage is how a scheduler turns a recovery into a
second outage.

## Time is UTC

Schedules use six-field UTC cron expressions. Named time zones are deliberately not supported yet.

The reason is that a local-time schedule is ambiguous twice a year. During a fall-back transition, 01:30 happens twice;
during spring-forward, it never happens. Every scheduler that supports named zones has to pick an answer, and the answer
is rarely what the user assumed. Rather than guess, `pgtask` requires you to be explicit in UTC until the behaviour is
specified and tested.

## Prompt changes

The scheduler listens on `pgtask_schedule` and `pgtask_wait` so a created, paused, or resumed schedule takes effect
immediately instead of at the next reconciliation.

As everywhere else, the notification is a latency optimisation. A periodic reconciliation covers a lost listener, and a
schedule created while every worker was down is still found when one starts.
