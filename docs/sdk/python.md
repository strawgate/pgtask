## Run a worker

A worker registers handlers and serves one queue:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
import os

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from pgtask import Task, TaskRegistry, Worker


class RenderRequest(TypedDict):
    report_id: str


class RenderResult(TypedDict):
    report_id: str
    attempt: int


tasks = TaskRegistry(queue_name="reports")


@tasks.task("reports.render")
async def render(task: Task, request: RenderRequest) -> RenderResult:
    return {"report_id": request["report_id"], "attempt": task.attempt}


asyncio.run(
    Worker(
        os.environ["PGTASK_DATABASE_URL"],
        tasks,
        health_address=os.getenv("PGTASK_HEALTH_ADDRESS"),
        listener_url=os.getenv("PGTASK_LISTENER_DATABASE_URL"),
    ).run()
)
```

The Rust runtime owns claiming, PostgreSQL notifications, leases, retries, scheduling, shutdown, and OpenTelemetry spans. The registered Python coroutine only runs the task body.

The worker fills its available handler slots with one claim per queue, up to `concurrency` tasks in total.

`TaskRegistry` is explicit worker configuration. It owns one logical queue and does not discover modules or use global state. The decorator returns a `TaskDefinition`, so producers can import `render` without repeating its durable name, queue, handler version, payload type, or result type.

Set `handler_version` when a long-lived task changes its durable protocol. An exception is retryable by default. Pass `retry_delay=None` for a terminal failure on the first exception.

## Enqueue and wait

The producer enqueues a task and waits on a notification rather than polling:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
import os

from pgtask import Client
from worker import render


async def main() -> None:
    client = await Client.connect(
        os.environ["PGTASK_DATABASE_URL"],
        listener_url=os.getenv("PGTASK_LISTENER_DATABASE_URL"),
    )
    task = await client.enqueue(
        render.request(
            {"report_id": "report-123"},
            idempotency_key="report-123:v1",
        )
    )
    result = await task.result(timeout=30)
    if result is None:
        raise TimeoutError("report did not finish")
    if result.state != "succeeded":
        raise RuntimeError(f"report failed: {result.error!r}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

`TaskHandle.result` subscribes to the task's deterministic result channel before it reads task state. Completion cannot be lost between the subscription and the read. One Rust listener connection multiplexes all result waits. A timeout returns `None` without changing the task. The handle also exposes `inspect`, `signal`, and `cancel`.

The query and listener endpoints default to the same URL. Set `listener_url` when queries use a transaction-pooling proxy. The listener endpoint must support PostgreSQL sessions. `max_query_connections` defaults to 10. `max_listener_connections` defaults to 1 because the Rust engine multiplexes subscriptions.

The client injects the active Python OpenTelemetry context into task headers. The worker restores that context around the Python handler. Database cancellation cancels the Python coroutine and runs its `finally` blocks.

## Enqueue a batch

Use one database round trip when you already have several tasks:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
import os

from pgtask import Client
from worker import render


async def main() -> None:
    client = await Client.connect(os.environ["PGTASK_DATABASE_URL"])
    tasks = await client.enqueue_many(
        [
            render.request({"report_id": "report-123"}),
            render.request({"report_id": "report-456"}),
        ]
    )
    print([task.id for task in tasks])


asyncio.run(main())
```

`enqueue_many` preserves request order. PostgreSQL accepts the complete batch in one transaction, so another session
never sees a partial batch.

## Run a durable workflow

Durable operations suspend the task into the database, so the handler resumes after a restart:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
import os

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from pgtask import Client, JSONValue, Task, TaskRegistry, Worker


class RenderRequest(TypedDict):
    report_id: str


tasks = TaskRegistry(queue_name="reports")
waiting = asyncio.Event()


@tasks.task("reports.render")
async def render(task: Task, request: RenderRequest) -> str:
    return f"rendered:{request['report_id']}"


@tasks.task("reports.approve")
async def approve(task: Task, request: RenderRequest) -> JSONValue:
    async def load_report() -> RenderRequest:
        return request

    report = await task.step("load-report", load_report)
    await task.sleep_for("settle", 0.1)
    waiting.set()
    approval = await task.wait_for_signal("wait-for-approval", "approval")
    child_id = await task.spawn("render-report", render.request(report))
    rendered = await task.wait_for_result("wait-for-render", child_id, timeout=600)
    return {"approval": approval, "rendered": rendered}


async def main() -> None:
    database_url = os.environ["PGTASK_DATABASE_URL"]
    client = await Client.connect(database_url)
    await client.migrate()
    worker = Worker(database_url, tasks, concurrency=10)
    running = asyncio.create_task(worker.run())
    try:
        workflow = await client.enqueue(approve.request({"report_id": "report-123"}))
        await waiting.wait()
        await workflow.signal("approval", {"approved": True})
        result = await workflow.result(timeout=30)
        if result is None or result.state != "succeeded":
            raise RuntimeError(f"workflow failed: {result!r}")
    finally:
        worker.shutdown()
        await running


asyncio.run(main())
```

Stop a worker with `worker.shutdown()` and then keep awaiting `run()`, as above. Handlers that are still running get
`shutdown_grace` seconds to finish (`Worker(..., shutdown_grace=30.0)` is the default). After that they are cancelled,
and their tasks go back to `pending` without using up an attempt. Cancelling the `run()` task does the same thing, then
re-raises `CancelledError` once the worker has stopped. A second cancellation stops waiting immediately, and those
tasks are recovered only when their leases expire.

`step` stores the operation result as JSON and reuses it after a retry or restart. `sleep_for`, `sleep_until`, `wait_for_signal`, and `wait_for_result` suspend the task and release its worker slot. `spawn` creates the child and records its identifier atomically.

Keep names and occurrences stable. Code outside a completed `step` can run again. Use `handler_version` when a deployment changes the order or meaning of durable operations.

## Reach the task from anywhere below the handler

Your handler receives the `Task` as an argument, which is all you need when you control every frame. When a
framework calls you back, you do not: nothing between `agent.run()` and the hook it invokes knows to forward
it. `get_current_task()` returns the task for the current call chain:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from pgtask import get_current_task


async def charge_with_retry_history() -> dict[str, str]:
    task = get_current_task()
    if task is None:
        raise RuntimeError("call this from inside a pgtask handler")
    return await task.step("create-charge", create_charge)
```

It returns `None` outside a handler, so library code can fall back instead of failing.

The task is stored in a `ContextVar` that the worker sets around each invocation, so two handlers running
under `concurrency > 1` each see their own task, and a `step` operation sees the task that started it.

## Enqueue in an application transaction

Pass your Psycopg connection and the task commits with your data:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
import os

from psycopg import AsyncConnection

from pgtask import Client
from worker import render


async def main() -> None:
    connection = await AsyncConnection.connect(os.environ["PGTASK_DATABASE_URL"])
    try:
        async with connection.transaction():
            await connection.execute("INSERT INTO reports (id) VALUES (%s)", ("report-123",))
            await Client.enqueue_on(
                connection,  # type: ignore[arg-type]
                render.request(
                    {"report_id": "report-123"},
                    idempotency_key="report-123:render",
                ),
            )
    finally:
        await connection.close()


asyncio.run(main())
```

`enqueue_on` uses the existing Psycopg connection. The task commit and the application write succeed or roll back together. It does not open another connection or commit the caller's transaction.

Use `Client.enqueue_many_on(connection, requests)` to enqueue a batch in the same application transaction. The
connection satisfies `BatchTransactionConnection`.

`Client.connect()` checks the storage protocol before returning. `enqueue_on` is the low-level transaction escape hatch.
Use it only after the application has established a compatible normal client during startup.

## Translate an ARQ enqueue

The shape stays familiar, with types and a transactional enqueue added:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
import os

from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

from pgtask import Client
from worker import render


async def main() -> None:
    client = await Client.connect(os.environ["PGTASK_DATABASE_URL"])
    task = await client.enqueue(
        render.request(
            {"report_id": "report-123"},
            idempotency_key="report-123:v1",
            run_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(seconds=5),
        )
    )
    await task.result(timeout=30)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Translate ARQ calls at the application boundary. Use payload objects, normal keyword arguments, and absolute `run_at`
times. `pgtask` deliberately has no ARQ-shaped client, magic `_defer_by` options, positional payload encoding, or Redis
compatibility layer. See [`pgtask` vs ARQ](../compare/arq.md) before you plan a cutover.
